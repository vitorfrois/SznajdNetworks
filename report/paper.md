    This paper presents a Machine Learning approach to predict Sznajd model dynamical variables in complex networks through topological features. When using topological measures as features for network characterization, it is possible to predict variables of dynamical systems with high accuracy. Exploring the convergence through topology and dynamics, this paper introduces a solid method for the prediction and answers questions related to polarization mechanisms in social interactions.
